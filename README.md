I came to **New York City** to study **graphic design at the School of Visual Arts**. I stuck around to develop and maintain sites for clients like Samsung and Verizon at **The Barbarian Group** and **Rokkan**. Now I work at **Peloton building UI components and design systems**.

I've been really into **Storybook** lately, and I was lucky enough to sit down and chat with them about [building Peloton's design system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXEu_C0hMjY). I also recently released a Storybook addon to [add responsive columns to your stories](https://storybook.js.org/addons/storybook-addon-responsive-columns).
